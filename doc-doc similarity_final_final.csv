Well written and performed also technically shines cinematography & bgm are too good and there's not even a single lag it's perfectly edited. Probably the best experience in recent times. Its pure art resembles the modern society the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional. If you like dark thrillers then you shouldn't miss Mr. Bong joon-ho's Parasite. Definitely tops the list of best movies in 2019.,"This is what cinema is supposed to be! Amazing chemistry and acting by both leads, seamless CGI and practical effects to enhance the film, a firecracker script, a true story, pulse pounding soundtrack, booming sound mix, and edited so well that 2.5 hours flies by! Completely and utterly engaging . So good in fact I saw it twice within 24 hours . Once in Imax and once in Dolby cinema .","While I did watch it till the end, I hated almost every minute of it. So much stupidity! No redeeming qualities except a few nice landscapes. If you want to watch a good military-related heist movie, see Three Kings with Wahlberg and Clooney."
"The film never really gives us the answers we crave, but rather serves up thought-provoking questions about perspective and the lies we tell ourselves and others in order to make sense of our circumstances. Walk in with an open mind, and prepare to expand your point of view. Kelvin Harrison Jr. KILLS it as well.","I saw this gem at a recent film festival. This is why I go to see movies - something original, something ""real,"" and something important. I didn't find it preachy at all, actually I thought it got it's point across in the best way possible - by being funny and entertaining. The movie starts off by grabbing your attention with how weak of a character Casey is, and how cruel his world is. His world is unrealistically desolate and lonely. But the way he rises out of it is why the movie goes from boring Wes Anderson fantasy to kick-ass Fight Club absurdity. Yes, there are absurd moments but they are completely consistent with the theme of the movie. A theme that needs to be shown again and again in cinema. I won't explicitly state it, but it is the reason this movie goes from average to great, albeit 45 minutes in. A little more gruesome than I'm used to, but I still enjoyed it.","The netflix trolls are strong with this one. The movie is plain boring. I literally fell asleep watching it. The actors are supposedly rejuvenated with cgi yet still look as the old farts they actually are what results in ridiculous dialogue for example Joe Pesci's character ""Russel"" is calling De Niro a kid like if he would be a young man. The story is boring lacking any build up or creating any tension what results in a very dull resolution of the movie. I can't believe it's from the same director that made great movies like ""Casino"" and ""Cape Fear."" This movie isn't worth a long review. I fell the need to warn people not to get fooled like I did by the high rating this movie has. I would give this movie a 4/10 but since the movie is overrated by fake reviews from netflix trolls I decided to give it the lowest rating possible to help to the contribution of balancing out the rating a little bit."
"I thought this movie was complete and utter garbage. I don't understand why people liked this movie so much. The character doesn't even stay true to the comics and the director flat out said it didn't, and then they made it seem like it was part of Gothams fall and he was just a little boy that had a laughing problem... Hated it","Very long. I hoped for the fear of chasing, but nothing happened. I was looking forward because there are multiple favorite actors, but the flimsy script was ruined.Moreover, like the game of thrones, the screen is too dark to look good.After all the gangsters don't come out and shoot with the children. Not worth seeing.","This was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, as well as the greatest ""horror"" film I have ever watched. This movie isn't your average Conjuring or Annabelle; there are no jump scares or dark scary hallways. The movie was set in Sweden in broad daylight, the horrors are the smiling people that have opened their Midsommar festival up to guests. I honestly think you will either love or hate this movie; the gore alone could scare at least half the audience away. Even those who hated it could still appreciate its beauty and art. The uniqueness of the plot alone is enough to at least respect it. One of my favorite movies- go see it.

"This is a plotless, exploitational film that uses violence not as a mean to tell a bigger story. Here, violence is the goal, the artifice to shock and persuade at the same time. I am appalled by the good reviews. As for the prizes, she has been awarded in Venice due to (or thanks to?) the scandal revolving around the journalist who yelled sexist atrocities at her. An atrocious film of gratuitous violence that has been awarded due to an atrocious act of sexism. That's not cinema. That's just....an atrocity.",Terrible 'film'. After the first hour I was disappointed yet I hoped the last stretch of the movie would be better. It was all so abrupt and unclear of what is happening. Terrible film.,"This flick has so many flaws. Zero heart. It's difficult to care for any characters, especially Ford II, he's portrayed as a hollow man so when the actor does a poor job, the result is a bad movie. The film correctly illustrates all the reasons United States is hated by nearly every nation, corporate greed. Foul language omission makes it an ok kids movie. Adults will walk away feeling empty."
"You have to be able to analyze movies to get this one in its entirety, but it is amazing. Completely mind-blowing, great acting, unexpected twist, and after you leave the theater, you have to analyze everything you just saw. Will probably see it again.","I'm assuming the low ratings are by comic book nerds. This movie was amazing. A laughed out loud, by myself, many times and cried a lot. I'm really surprised by how much considering this is just a block buster super hero movie. The thing is, I actually like movies. And I know they are entertainment. Are there holes in the time travel plot? Sure, but who cares. Just use your imagination to fill in the holes. Or don't think about it too much. It's not real life folks. I'm just grateful I live in the exact period of time where movies like this are possible. It's amazing what they can do. Imagine someone from the 1920's or 1820's saw this? Be grateful. This movie was a masterpiece. If you want less plot holes, watch a film, or read a book. This is a movie. And a damn good one.

"I don't understand what the intention of the director is? What does he want to explain or to prove? Is it a critic of social inequalities? Is it a thriller? A comedy? I don't know and none of these styles is addressed adequately. This movie is clearly overrated. For sure, it is deranged and make you feel very uncomfortable sometimes. But for what purpose? I don't know. It proves one thing: that the Cannes festival is a get-together of crazy bonkers who call themselves artists - which clearly they are not.
","In spite of the excellent reviews, this movie was painful to watch and absolutely repulsive. It got worse the longer I watched. So, what's my problem? I'm a pretty intelligent, educated 75 year old, and I am willing to watch edgy stuff. I can list a dozen edgy foreign movies with subtitles that were excellent, set in Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, and South Korea, etc. There are many moviegoers like me who need a little affirmation of the human spirit in films. This film has none. And, the reviewers who have rated it so highly can only be suspect for there sense of humanity and value. Beware the Metascore!!!!
","I don't like De niro's political rants but I will not allow them to influence my respect of great acting, directing and storyline. This had all those in spades and didn't need fast cuts and fast action. You enter their world and the cold reality of a gangsters less glamorous side bares it soul and it's a sad but poignant reality. Excellent nuanced acting make this a true masterpiece of cinema. Do not miss this film!!!

"I managed to watch Uncut Gems at New York Film Festival and I can say that it's one of, if not his best performance to date. For certain parts of the film, I forget that I was watching Adam Sandler cause you know, you are just used to see him in so many comedies but given the right material, he's actually full of potential in serious and dramatic roles like this. He completely disappears into the role. Adam Sandler is at his best when he's just acting in a movie and has no actual significant creative input over the movie's direction. Thank God to the directors, Safdi Brothers.
","I think this is the best movie all year in my opinion and one of the best thrillers I have ever seen it has a very interesting story and Adam Sandler best performance, the movie never stops moving it always has your heart beating and it makes you feel for Adam Sandler character I promise you will say ""Why are doing that you idiot"" through out the whole movie you will say that, the film makes you like him, makes you care for him so I highly recommend this movie, this film got my heart beating more than A high budget action movie so please watch this film it's worth every penny
","This was such an unnecessary waste of time. I don't even understand how or why this movie got made. I understand it before going to see it and assumed we would find out why the lie was one that was such an important line to keep and that isn't the case, there is simply no explanation. There was no emotion or comedy and the acting was not good, nor was there anything else to the lackluster plot. This story could've been told in two minutes and it was so slow and painful to sit there and it was pointless. The idea of the story drew me to see it, but I felt zero emotion from the characters and we didn't even really get a glimpse about the Grandmother's life or the story and history of the family. Absolutely awful!!!
"
"This movie was boring and unoriginal like most Netflix movies. The production and acting was fine but nothing really made any real sense. Sci fi or not, logic is right out the window like most attempts these days. It could've been nice but it fell short and melted in the ice. A nice puddle of could-a woulda-a. Fail, Netflix.","Sorry I watched it just such a boring waste of time I seen Many science fiction movies of the same genre can't understand when there's so much good science fiction out there they chose this one my recommendation is don't bother watching
","With current poltical noise and extreme Winter climes, I chose to go and see this movie. It's hilarious, filled with tender, and endearing moments. Worth the money! Thanks to The Rock!
"
This was a fantastic movie. Zac Efron did an amazing job with the same facial expression and charisma as Bundy had. They didnt go into much depth on the brutality of the murders which I really appreciate. It was more about the emotional damage put on Liz and her perspective of it all. This movie is amazing,"A sprawling, gritty action noir, gorgeously lit and morally challenging, where, as always, it is survival of whoever, beneath their mask, happens to be the fittest (and the smartest). Potentially one of the most engrossing 158-minute films you'll ever sit through.
","This films is like watching someone else play a video game, and that someone has put in the immortality cheat. After 15-20 minutes, it's dull, repetitive and then ultimately stupid and lacking in any humanity.
"
"Rating 10/10 I was able to catch an advanced screening of this movie on 13th of may 2019. One words i can say here is 'amazing' yes ... this movie so amazing !! One of the best action movie i ever seen. All the fighting scenes were choreographed wonderfully according to my opinion. Excellent acting performance by Keanu Reeves a.k.a John Wick. The guns shooting scenes were entirely cool. I would recommend this movie to any fans of action movie. You won't find a better movie of this type in the theatre right now and for the fans out there who appreciate this material, it will provide a memorable experience. Go see it you wont regret it.","This is was the greatest viewing experience of a film I have had in a cinema since Jurassic Park came out in 1993. With amazing set designs, incredible character building, action sequences that are perfectly choreographed and three canine actors that are either too badass or too cute to handle. This is one of the, if not, most ambitious films with a flawless execution. A visual masterpiece that shows that Chad Stahelski as an action film director, is a force to be reckoned with.
","I don't usually go out of a movie, but this one was just probably the worst movie I've seen in my life. Disgusting humour, very bad acting and incredibly slow pacing. We just couldn't waste our time to watch this through and it was a good decision.
"
"Well made, good pacing, quite informative film about Dick Cheney's life. It seemed to tell the story without being judgemental. There is so much to tell that some events are quickly addressed for the sake of time, but it was important enough that it needed to be included, i.e., the hunting accident. The transformation of the actors into the characters is amazing. Highly recommend.","I've never felt more joy or sadness watching a film. It's well written, acted, and directed. It's visual metaphors and motifs are chilling. In my opinion, it's possibly the most important film of my generation. Absolutely loved it, even though it was gut wrenching.
","My Eyes! I don't understand the rating behind this movie. I couldn't even finish it because of the god awful animation. The way the characters move disoriented me and hurt my eyes so bad, I had to leave theater. I was determined to finish the movie so I came back and just listened to it with my eyes shut. Even then it was still awful.
"
"I've been looking forward to this being released for months and let me tell you it did not disappoint!. The acting and shift between funny and drama is perfectly done, one minute you are laughing and the next nearly in tears. This is a wonderful film and one of the most stand out films of the year for me. I hope this gets recognition with awards because it was truly stunning. You can always tell when a film is special when you sit in silence after it has finished.
","I just saw this movie today with a friend, and it was absolutely incredible. I myself have never had to battle addiction but it was very eye opening to see the reality of it. I definitely think it is a movie that society needs to see right now. My friend and I talked about it long after it ended, it definitely impact the way we think and the way we perceive those around us who may be struggling. Hats off to everyone involved in the making of this film, the cast, director, writers, crew and the actual Shefs for sharing this story.
","Absolutely no cinematic value, completely crap. Such rating only because of thousands blind teenagers fans. If you are not a fan - you only gonna waste your time and never get it back...
"
"Bradley cooper and Lady Gaga collaboration on this remake of the classic A Star Is Born results in an outstanding movie and soundtrack that keeps you looking ofr more until the very end of the movie.
","It's just incredible how a movie in one room, with just one main character, a microphone and a computer takes you inside like this. In some way, you create the whole movie with your imagination. Congratulations to the actor by the way.
","Tried to watch this for ten minutes, maybe twenty. I gave it twenty. It was dumb and pointless. Someone connected got this movie made and thought it was so profound. I gave it a chance. It just seems this is the movie everyone is pretending to like this year because someone else claimed it was good. It was not. Don't waste your time.
"
"This movie shows the humanity, insanity, and personal struggle for perfection it takes to do things that no one else has done and few to none have tried to accomplish. Possible the best movie I have ever seen in terms of drawing you in, keeping a strangle hold on your attention, and not just rushing to the juicy parts but letting you savor the journey. Alex Honnold you are an inspiration to the world. Never stop. ""What you are afraid to do is a clear indicator of the next thing you need to do."" -Ralph Waldo Emerson","This is the best documentary I have ever seen. It takes you inside the mind and life of one of the world's best rock climbers. The visuals are incredible. You get to feel a bit what it is like to climb what to most of us would be a blank vertical wall rock wall overlooking heaven.
","This is probably one of the most disappointing movies of recent years. I watched this movie after reading some highly positive reviews; some even went on to dub it as the movie of the year. A total mismatch between what I read, and what I saw. And, to call it a thriller would be a total injustice to the word itself. See it at your own risk.
"
"Silence is often the most deafening sound. A loss can trigger the strongest of emotions. And there is nothing louder in this film than the quiet performances of its leads and virtually say everything especially in moments when no words are exchanged. I watched this one as part of the London Film Festival 2016 and it blew me away for its equal measures of heart, humour, love, despair and humanity. The casting is superb and deserve to scoop up the awards of the year in a story which even though one can guess from the start what is in its nucleus, we sit and admire the masterful director peel it off to gradually reveal an even richer and more layered core.
","Your Name is one of my favorite movies of all time and will always have a special place in my heart. Its animation, soundtrack, story, everything about it is just amazing and something barely seen. The Idea that the two main characters switch bodies every once in a while is something almost never seen in anime and it pulls it off perfectly. It has one of the biggest twists and a very satisfying ending that will keep you on your toes for the whole of part 2 just to get to it. You can tell that there was an immense amount of effort and passion put into this film and I beg you to watch this masterpiece.
","This is definitely the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm not sure who thought it would be a good idea to take this play and turn it into a movie, but they were wrong. There really was no story, no change of scenery and no message. This movie simply invites you into the lives of 5 miserable people living depressing, miserable lives. Who wants to watch that? Yes the actors were believable and did a good job portraying their characters, but that was the only redeeming thing about this film. I left feeling uninspired, bored and drained of all happiness. I truly would have preferred to sit and look at a blank screen for 2 hours then to have to watch this. Do yourself a favor and go see ANYTHING else.
"
"This movie is a huge disappointment, and a waste of money and time. The jokes are stupid and I realize that Deadpool is not what it was cracked up to be. Too bad as I usually love the Marvel movies. It seems forced, and the jokes actually become tedious and not really with any sophistication at any level, more adolescent bathroom style humor. The story and plot is also dull and tedious which goes along with the dull and tedious jokes. At times I thought to walk out, but kept hoping that there would be a redeeming aspect as many of the reviews were positive, I kept hoping. This movie is more about money-making hype, with its non existent story/plot and childish humor with no depth. A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.
","This movie is awful and is only liked by 10 years old. It's pointless and half the movie doesn't make sense. Don't waste your money or time. Only fan boys and people who don't take movies seriously enjoy these type of dumb movies. I guess it takes no plot, terrible acting and a few funny jokes to make a movie. The fact this movie made so much money is beyond me. There was no effort involved. The director , the producer and actors should be ashamed. They're robbing you of your money and times. THEY JUST MAKE A FEW FUNNY JOKES AND ITS RATED A HIGH 8 RATING LIKE IS THAT ALL YOU NEED A FEW FUNNY JOKES AND NO PLOT WHATS SO EVER TO MAKE A ""GOOD"" MOVIE!!!!!! I can go on and on but just don't waste your time !!! Deadpool sucks!!!
","This movie is excellent. The most striking thing to me was the cinematography. You could take a screen capture at just about any point in the movie and have a photo worth framing. It's stylistically excellent, and was a work of art visually. The writing was great, especially in the sense of the character personalities. Every character had depth and interest. I wouldn't call it a twist ending by any means, but I thought I had it called and I didn't. The music added a lot as well. If you like darkish new-westerns, this is definitely worth considering.
"
"Worst Michael Bay movie ever, based on a true story but has nothing to do with the true story, terrible cast... a shoot'em up fest for the dimwits and ignorants as the mercenary thugs savages of blackwater tell the US officials what to do and shouting orders at them and even dictating policy and then going Rambo on the locals...what a nauseating movie and story
","This was the most cringing film seen; it had such promise with the humorous credits introduction and the funky cartoon type. It started well with a few wise cracks, but they sadly did not stop. It was one constant barrage of supposedly witty chat and streams of consciousness from the main character. The action was impressive, with an incredible amount of violence, blood and scenes of a sexual nature (very questionable rating which I would not recommend for below adult viewing. The problem with this film was the lack of connectivity or sense of empathy generated for the ""super hero"". It may have been the aim to have such a frustratingly grating protagonist, however it detracted from a potentially very good film. I have never felt so dissatisfied with the sense that I have wasted my time watching this ""sadly not Kickass"" film.
","I felt that this movie was a instant contender for best war movie when I watched it. Compared to Saving Private Ryan, it has definitely benefited from the technology of today's age. The story line itself was very inspirational and a heart warming experience that was moving from start to finish.
"
"Beautifully written, directed and acted film. The very funny bittersweet dialogues are brilliant. This is really a great lovely movie and definitely deserves all the awards.
","Your name is a unique screenplay with a unique story twist the film is full of drama / romance even mystery a great story with a great fiction the graphic that is perfect, Comfortable and attractive with a great soundtrack that get you in the mood The most interesting thing about the film is the design of characters, their behavior and their causes And the new fiction the plot was interesting and it was flow very well
","This was one of the greatest disappointments to me as a movie. There are great (if repetitive) special effects. Very impressive, they must have enormous computational power to achieve this. But are special effects enough to make a movie? I don't think so. There is really no story. No tension. Why no mind-games? One might expect these with Benedict Cumberbatch as the lead. Why wasn't Dr. Strange faced with some terrible ethical dilemma? The climactic scene is pathetic, with no drama, no suspense. Do truly evil beings REALLY always keep their word? Sophomoric writing throughout, and some good actors trying hard to make something of it, but they were doomed to failure.
"
"From the storyline, to the animation, this movie attempts to break molds and make it into an actual work of art. It manages on all grounds, following a trend I truly love from Laika Studios where they truly want to tell a story and go for it, without aiming to ride the cliche and trends of the month wave to farm easily swayed crowds, presenting a mature story with imaginative turns at every corner. No amount of stars do justice to how much I love the effort put behind this movie, and I would never take anyone seriously if they were to tell me otherwise.","By far, my favourite of the Star War movies. Great CGI. Epic soundtrack. Human stories. Great performances. Many wonderful cameos. Heroism at great cost. The power of hope. This was my second viewing of many more to come. I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {SciFi Action Adventure}
","bad acting, stupid dialogue, bad script, and worst of all is the use of obscenity and sexual references trying to fix the hole idea. I understand and known all my life that the character from the comic is similar, but in the movie the deeper exploring of this resources instead of trying to tell a better story or even the writing seems to me a lack of creativity and poor ethics. The only character creation was done in Vanessa interpreted by Morena Baccain who deserves a 9/10 in her role for this movie. Woudn't go tho the theater if there is a sequel and would recommend to start fresh from scrap if there's still interest in delivering any other Deadpool Movie, this beloved antihero deserves more...
"
"I felt this movie was a bit slow to start but it picked up momentum. It's rare to find movies that can really capture the essence of pure evil. The Witch is a gem for sure because it not only captures that essence but it makes it beautiful and hideous at the same time. The acting, story line, costumes, soundtrack, everything..amazing! Such a fantastic work of art that I am happy to own and watch again and again. It's too bad that a lot of people today do not have an appreciation for artsy films. The characters, although not overly developed add so much intrigue to the story--there is much left untold coming in to the movie and it leaves you with so many possibilities afterward. There are just some movies that never leave you and this is one of them, at least for me.
","An excellent film in every way. I cannot fault it on any level. A brilliant storyline, superbly acted and directed. Add to that the tremendous soundtrack and great cinematography and a film has been created which I will happily revisit time and time again. The wonderful Jeff Bridges, as he always seems to, gives real depth and integrity to his character. The relationship between Ben Foster and Chris Pine is always engaging. The brief, hilarious cameo scene from Margaret Bowman, an 88 year old actress, will forever after be etched in my memory. All in all, a real contender for the Best Picture Oscar. Win or lose, David Mackenzie has done us all a favour by reminding us that the best action movies don't rely on crash bang wallop pyrotechnics or high speed chases.
","I never give movie reviews, but I just saw Deadpool and really wish someone had warned me about it or I had some way to pay to unsee it. It is definitely NOT a superhero movie or a love story. I'm extremely disappointed that Marvel and Ryan Reynolds made this. It was gratuitously bloody and filled with vulgar bathroom and sex jokes. Some of the jokes might have been worth laughing at had they been in another movie, but I was too disgusted overall to crack a smile. I'm trying to think of a worse possible movie. Maybe if you remade John Wick with Jim Carrey telling jokes as he shoots people and cuts them up. If you have teenagers, I would keep them far away from it.
