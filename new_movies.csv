0,"I went into this film with fairly high hopes for it. Yeah, those hopes died about ten minutes in. Everyone is yelling in practically every scene, and there's a strange, vaguely 80's sounding soundtrack blaring in every scene. The first two acts are a mess, though the third act is a bit easier to follow, but ultimately doesn't offer all that much of a story. So, to sum it up, I'd rather watch 'Billy Madison' while getting dental work done than this trainwreck of a film."
1,"I am pretty sure this would be an Oscar nod for Sandler. One thing I can say for sure is that I have never been a Sandler fan. I have deliberately avoided his movies all along - I never liked him on SNL. In fact, I hate his moronic idiotic drooling expressions and acting. But boy did he break all my perceptions of him in this gem! This is not a movie to watch in cinema for sure. Watch it at leisure at home with possibly taking a break or two in between. It is intense and will draw you in."
1,"Movie presents a fantastic storytelling. Screenplay is outstanding. Cast is superable. It looks like a Joker. But this movie enforce abnormal level of anxiety - sounds, camera and visual effects hing your mind even after leaving the theater.
"
0,"This movie ranks in my top 5 worst movies of all time. Lots of yelling, jerky camera motion that made me nauseous, the ""f"" word made up most of the dialog. The story was awful as well. Eight of us went to see this and we all hated it. If I was watching it at home I would have turned it off after 15 minutes."
1,"This is what cinema is supposed to be! Amazing chemistry and acting by both leads, seamless CGI and practical effects to enhance the film, a firecracker script, a true story, pulse pounding soundtrack, booming sound mix, and edited so well that 2.5 hours flies by! Completely and utterly engaging . So good in fact I saw it twice within 24 hours . Once in Imax and once in Dolby cinema ."
0,"Like many American films this title attempts to rewrite history. The truth is that Ferrari were the complete underdog. What actually happened is that huge behemoth motor company Ford tried to buy the tiny Ferrari and Enzo said no. Ford threw their toys out of the pram and decided to build the GT40. With their limitless budget it took a few years for them to finally succeed at beating the tiny Ferrari company at Le Mans. And even when they did, Ford used a 5 litre engine versus Ferrari's 3 litre. This film needs remaking to tell what really happened and who the reall heroes were. They would be wearing red overalls thats for sure."
0,"This movie might have been better titled ""The Ken Miles Bio"" for the almost complete absence of point to point competition between the two car marques. Hollywood has yet to make an excellent racing movie but this one isn't even in the top ten. I gave it a three for excellence in period features such as technology, classic cars and the like. The secondary actors were better than the primaries. Don't waste your money."
1,"Not a massive fan of motor racing or motor racing movies but i did enjoy this. The major asset for the film is the cast, Matt Damon is very good but the real star of this is the fantastic Christian Bale, a superb performance from a great actor. The story of an unsung British hero, a very modest and a very real hero, he did really drive a tank in WW2, is a tale very much worth telling. It is long bit flies by - go see."
1,"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway."
1,"Seriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger? If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time"
0,"I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society."
0,The acting is good but they waste the movie time with repeating the same subject there is a missing part in movie to give attention to the storyline Just watched him laughing only and the repeated it many times for nothing Actually i did not complete the last 10 minutes as it was boring and each time tried to leave i was saying just give it another 10 minutes maybe something will happen but really nothing
1,"Irishman is maybe the last piece of cinematic art so far. Today we're just attacked by hundreds of superheroes on the big screen, with scenes and dialogs who goes so fast, faster than blinking your eyes. After Tarantinos 'Once Upon A Time in Hollywood' we will no longer have the opportunity to enjoy slow montage footage and brilliant cult dialogues, and this movie will, thank God, give us the opportunity to enjoy it again.
"
1,"Scorsese, De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci are all operating at the top of their game. The 3 1/2 hour run time never sags. One of the great crime epics. Not since Once Upon A Time in America has a gangster epic been so superb."
0,"I guess the Hollywood people are so used to seeing 80 y/os with dyed dark hair and lots of plastic surgery, but us little people in Flyover country aren't It's kinda pathetic seeing an old DeNiro beating up a guy and acting the tough guy. The energy from all of the actors isn't there. It doesn't work at all for me."
0,Had hard time watching this film. Was expecting something interesting. 3+ hours about nothing. Either there are paid reviews out there or people don't know what they are talking about. Mediocre movie at best.
1,"Well, if you're looking for a cult, intellectual movie to brag about over a dinner or a couple of drinks with your friends and have an argument about it (like ""sometimes disgusting and frustrating"" kind of an argument) this ain't that, but, I need to add a huge BUT, if you'r in a mood to welcome a kind of a human bonding that no matter what, it would still warm up your heart, go for it. Watch this movie, and you'll feel better. It will put you in a better mood. That's all I have to say regardless of actors, the director and so on, who they have done a medium high level of work in this movie for making it work. ""Beautiful in its' simplest way"" means the beauty that we all could (and probably have) experienced, relating and connecting to others in an unexceptional and an un-programmed way."
1,"Yeah I know but just stick with me here. I honestly haven't experience such road movie escapist charm since the above classic. The chemistry between all players was perfection. I'd like to believe they knew what they had hence the appearance of a period Trans Am. A ridiculous goal, picking up a beautiful brunette along the way, an outlaw with an illegal cargo. Yep it's all there. Sort of. Look just let this movie in, you'll have a blast. Tremendous fun."
0,I'm not sure why this got so many good reviews. It just wasn't believable because it lacked so much depth. I was bored right up to the end. I thought maybe the ending would save it. Nope.
0,"I'm still bothered two weeks after seeing this movie. I feel had. A warm, fuzzy, totally predictable outing. Good performances by good actors, but a fluff of a story. I do love the coastal setting, but witnessed the worst special effects (that wrestling scene) that I've seen since the early godzillas..."
1,"Richard Jewell is a great story, a tragedy that needed to be told. It is a shameful episode of both media hysteria and the excesses of inept law enforcement and abuse of an accused citizen. In this story, the media is shown rushing to judgement and convicting an innocent person in the press and on TV, a person who is ignorant of the power of the press, and the power that the FBI has to crush persons who are accused or suspected of crimes. The FBI repeatedly ignores the rights of the accused and tries to trick Jewell into confessing without meaning to, with blatant disregard for both ethics and the law itself. The corrosion that was so pervasive in 1996 is still there- and has grown to immense proportions. The other element to this story, the lack of care taken by the news media is also relevant today. In this story the reporter who wrote the story naming Jewell as the main suspect eventually discovered the truth and attempted to correct the error as best she could unlike today- the media are dangerously taking sides on political issues rather than reporting or doing the job of a journalist. This is destroying trust of the media as surely as the politicization of the FBI and Justice Department will destroy the faith in the Federal government itself. Mr. Eastwood's film is sounding an alarm. Will anyone listen ?"
1,"Even as a former prosecutor I would have liked to arrest the FBI and media people who ruined Richard Jewell's reputation, life.I wish at the end the movie clarified how he won some settlements against the offending newspaper and others. Clint Eastwood is truly amazing as an actor and a director."
1,"It was pretty much exactly what I expected which is a really enjoyable and lighthearted superhero film with some funny moments and that will be enough for most people but it just didn't blow me away. No way this is a 10 like some are suggesting and to nitpick, adult Billy acts nothing like young Billy at all. Don't get me wrong - its still a fun movie which I can recommend."
1,"Shazam is a solid family oriented film, enough laughs to make it enjoyable. The film is almost a standard superhero film. What I would say is that I did think some scenes felt long and at times I was ready for the next one. It is a typical superhero film with a villain but I wish sometimes we had a film of just Shazam showing us his awesome quirky self, you know like a film based on learning about his powers and the relationship of his side kick, like a building block to support the next one. I give Shazam 7/10"
0,"When the 1st preview came out, showing a stuffed suit Shazam with a kids mind, I thought, no. No way . I won't be seeing this bomb. Then my wife said she wanted to see it, so there I was. I had some Marvel family comics as a kid, saw the Saturday morning tv show, I don't remember billy staying billy after he shazamed. He became captain marvel. The whole kid in a superhero body theme was awful. I was wish this movie over. The last 15 minutes got ok, but didn't save it. Who is giving this 9 and 10's?"
0,"Extremely lighthearted to the point I was never concerned about the wellbeing of any of the main characters. The plot was a typical origin story, new powers, adjusting to his new role etc..as recent as this movie tries to be, the jokes are very dated, as is his lame dance(very 2016). This isn't a movie I'd recommend and definitely don't need to see a sequelz"
0,"Remember subtly? This film surely doesn't. Another script that was simplified for overseas viewing, and had to explain every joke and every moral message. In 'Big' Tom Hanks was a kid trying to be an adult, Zachary Levi chose to be an adult acting like a kid. That choice took all the heart out of Shazam. Watching this film was like watching Jimmy Fallon skits in which he attempts to be a superhero over and over again. Also, Corey Haim's performance in Dream a Little Dream seems to have been ripped off and poorly copied. Nothing original, just a film made to make money. It's like Deadpool and Superman and Big all wrapped up into one. Except, bad. REALLY bad."
0,"This film is for kids and adults with a Disney complex. Cliche scripting, nonsensical scenarios, terrible acting, and an all around commercial formula movie plot. If you like little kid superhero movies watch this. To further, the maturity level is less than Avengers (which is pretty low as well). Am pondering who I should email at rotten tomatoes to get my refund for this after taking their 90% rating seriously."
1,"The Lighthouse is a visually stunning art piece. It creates constant tension with only two characters and minimalistic spaces. it's drunkenly metaphorical and leaves you in a dreamlike state that has you questioning reality. Great performances, great photography. My only complaint would that it is at times too theatrical, and violence seems a bit arbitrary. if you like art films and R.P's abs, this film is for you."
0,"I'm not a professional reviewer. For me, I enjoyed the acting in the film. I didn't see point to the story, didn't feel like benefited from seeing this film and felt it difficult to see through to the end. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a bad movie, I think the sound, the cinematography was all good and as said the acting. But the story, I guess I missed the point here."
1,"I was dragged to the theater by my Dolemite-loving boyfriend and expected to be totally bored. WRONG! This was soooo good. The actors were great and clearly having fun, the costumes were amazing and the filmmakers actually made the 70's seem magical. Even though the language definitely justified an R rating, the film was quite heartwarming; nothing depressing or dark."
0,"Eddie basically knows his career is over and here he tries to redeem himself and it doesn't work at all, the movie wasn't funny and is just straight up race baiting bulls*it. don't waste your time"
1,"The best thing I can compare Avengers: Infinity War to is a high speed roller coaster. From the first action sequence to the last the viewer is flung around various battles, universes and emotions. Thanos was much better developed than I expected, and seeing many characters from different films finally interact was rewarding for those who have been watching MCU films since they first came out. While IW was not the best or deepest super hero movie I've seen, it is unlike any other cinematic experience I have ever had. It's easily the closest I've felt to reliving Saturday morning super hero cartoons in theaters, especially with the ""to be continued"" ending. I was expecting pure fun and I got exactly that. Can't wait for the next one."
1,"Infinity War is a astonishing film which serves as the culmination of everything that occurred in MCU since the first pictures. Would seem, the movie had to turn out obscure and overloaded, but screenwriters so skillfully bring one moment to another that the movie bewitches with the first until the last minute. ""War"" connects those who didn't know about existence of each other, divides the teams which developed in the past, transfers characters from one region of the Galaxy in another, accompanying everything with grandiose battles. At the same time the narration remains clear and fascinating. Of course, if you've watched the previous movies. It's not a movie for those who want to get acquainted with Captain America, Thor, Hulk and other famous characters. The film is shot for fans, and the better you know the MCU story, the you derive bigger pleasure from viewing."
0,"Keep in mind that just because s movie makes billions, that does not make it a good movie. Like most of Marvel movies this is an insipid mess. The entire plot took 10 years to develop and is summed up in this latest entry in 4 or 5 sentences. Acting isn't necessary or required, just grimace and look sweaty and vacant. Meanwhile we'll fill the screen with 50,000 CGI lights and explosions and convince you what is happening matters. Well it doesn't."
0,The director has just spaffed action scenes in one after the other in a confusing non-chronological order. Anyone who knows Marvel will expect more and anyone who doesn't will be confused.
1,"The film has action in it, but its not only about fighting. There are bad characters, who are indeed not entirely evil. There are good characters, who are not without mistakes and weaknesses. Besides I loved the storyline, the characters, the acting, and loved the music. I do not give a damn about the colour of the actors skin in any of the films. It is an awesome film, thats all"
1,"Black Panther is certainly a good movie, but I don't feel like it truly capitalizes on its interesting premise and setting enough to elevate above other Marvel movies. It still follows the formula and doesn't stray far enough away from it to make truly distinct. However, I did love the action scenes (which there was surprisingly little of), Michael B Jordan as Killmonger (surprisingly good villain to be honest), pretty much all the Wakanda stuff, the soundtrack and the core story. I just wish it had been less restricted by the studio. Black Panther is a good film, but it could've been a great one, which is disappointing."
0,"Visually, cool as heck. Effects were on point. Michael B Jordan as a villain was AMAZING. All else...skip. I wanted to like this movie and looked forward to it after BP's debut in Civil War. His character and performance, and the movie wasn't nearly as good as BP in Civil War. I was very disappointed last night. And I'm a huge fan of the MCU."
0,"Lasted an hour before I bailed. I like the cast but the movie is done in by terrible writing that most of the actors could not overcome. Halfway through the film and there's little to no character development. I have no reason to care about 99.9% of the people on the screen. As a huge fan of the preceding films, I expected much more from Black Panther. Very disappointing. The hype and over-the-top praise of this movie is misplaced."
